# Bank Data Analysis

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing information about customers' demographics and banking activities. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, as well as to build predictive models for various business tasks such as customer segmentation, churn prediction, or targeted marketing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains the following columns:

- `age`: Age of the customer
- `job`: Occupation of the customer
- `marital`: Marital status of the customer
- `education`: Level of education of the customer
- `default`: Whether the customer has credit in default
- `balance`: Average yearly balance in euros
- `housing-loan`: Whether the customer has a housing loan
- `personal-loan`: Whether the customer has a personal loan
- `current-campaign`: Number of contacts performed during this campaign for the customer
- `previous-campaign`: Number of contacts performed before this campaign for the customer
- `subscribed`: Whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (target variable)

## Analysis

The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships between variables, as well as predictive modeling to predict customer subscription to term deposits. Various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests are employed for modeling, and performance metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix are used for evaluation.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis:

1. Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the `analysis` folder to reproduce the analysis.
4. Explore the results and modify the code as needed for further experimentation.
